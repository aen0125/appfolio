        Ingredients: Miko Brand Instant Miso Soup Awase-Variety-30%, Coleslaw Mix, Konjac Fettucine Noodle
        Cooking: 1. I'd recommend to boil water and rinse 1 pack of Shirataki fettuccine 
        noodle thoroughly to get rid of the fishy smell. Don't reuse the fishy water with miso soup!
        2. Use 4 ounces of coleslaw mix. Wash the coleslaw and drain.
        3. Pour 6 oz of water into a pot with 1 serving of the miso soup base with the cole slaw until soup boils.`
